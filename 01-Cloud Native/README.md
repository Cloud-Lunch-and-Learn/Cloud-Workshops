# Cloud Native Workshop

If you are new to Cloud-Native or have experience with it and its associated concepts and technologies such as containerization, orchestration, and microservice applications, in that case, this workshop is for you. We designed this workshop specifically to help you apply the concepts learned about Cloud Native apps, while designing a real-world solution to fit the business needs of a ficticious company.

The workshop is based on a use case designed by the team to help you understand common business requirements while building Cloud Native solutions.

You will receive a set of resources that will guide and help you learn how to build each of the components part of the final solution. Most of the time, you will be working offline while learning to develop these components, and then on the workshop's day, you learn how to connect all the components and build the end-to-end solution that meets the business requirements and scope of the use case.
